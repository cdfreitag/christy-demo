      <p>"One of the unique things about ice climbing in Michigan is we have something nobody else has, and that’s Lake Superior," Thompson said. "Climbing over open water is something you can’t do anywhere else in the world. We have miles and miles of ice. Lots of ice, Lake Superior – it’s the place to climb."
